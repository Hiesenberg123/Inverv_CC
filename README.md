R codes used for Sampling and Tables generation for State wide Telephonic surveys
We had a large Telephonic Number Database of citizens across the state with their name. Our first challenge was to select some 30000 odd phone numbers for calling across the state
We used quota sampling to have a balance sample space representing different sections of society in proportion of their population
Second was to give weights and generating table for final report.
All the codes are there.
